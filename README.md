# Danger_Dungeon
A simple chance-based game that uses console graphics.
You play as a person (portrayed by the letter C) who has ended up trapped inside a dungeon filled with various creatures and traps (represented by #). It is clear where the exit (portrayed by the letter E) is, but it's locked, and you can't tell the difference between the key and the traps. The only way to win is to find the key among the traps and reach the exit before you die.
